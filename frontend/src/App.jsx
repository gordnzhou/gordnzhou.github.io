                <p class="p-about">I am a third-year Math and Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia. 
                I've always loved coding - from making silly Discord bots in Grade 9 to now exploring new technologies like game console emulation and web development.
                Beyond coding, I enjoy hiking, gaming, experimenting in the kitchen, and learning new languages.</p>
